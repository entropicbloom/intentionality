fix:
- rerun main experiments with new multiply_transpose preprocessing

controls
- try to decode based on only 0 and 1 underlying output neurons as decoder inputs (should fail because of symmetry)
- trivial synthetic decoder input control (?)

more decoding setups
- train/valid splits with different network hidden layer sizes and num layers
    - new base model dataset with 200 seeds of different hidden layer sizes
    - new base model dataset with 200 seeds of different number of layers
    - new base model dataset with 200 seeds of different hidden layer sizes
- variable number of hidden layers within data set
- pixel position
- generative + dropout
- color?

activity
- implement procedure to get functional from structural connectivity
    - create rate based dynamical system from existing structure, with additional noise source from every neuron
- re-train decoder with functional connectivity

accuracy improvements
- add previous layers to decoder input
