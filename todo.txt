- clean up code
- network size dataset

activity
- implement procedure to get functional from structural connectivity
    - create rate based dynamical system from existing structure, with additional noise source from every neuron
- re-train decoder with functional connectivity


accuracy improvements
- add previous layers to decoder input


other cases 
- untrained underlying network control -> high priority
- trivial synthetic decoder input control
- variable hidden layer size within data set -> high priority
- variable number of hidden layers within data set -> high priority
- pixel position
- generative + dropout
- color?
